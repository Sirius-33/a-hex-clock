## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed the latest version of `npm`
* You have installed the latest version of `node.js`

## Installing <a_hex_clock>

To install, type this in your terminal:


```py
$ npm init
$ npx a-hex-clock
```

Afterwards you are going to want copy the code to your desired location of the module. Here's the src link's for stylesheet and script - just to save you some time ;)
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/hexClock.css">
<script src="../js/hexClock.js" defer></script>

if above doesn't work:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./src/css/hexClock.css">
<script src="./src/js/hexClock.js" defer></script>

comments will explain where you can apply your own styling / theme.
